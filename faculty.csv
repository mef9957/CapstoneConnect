Today's technologies are helping people collect and produce data at phenomenal rates. Despite the abundance of data, it remains largely inaccessible due to the skill required to explore, query and analyze it in a non-trivial fashion. While many users know exactly what they are looking for, they have trouble expressing sophisticated queries in interfaces that require knowledge of a programming language or a query language. Azza designs novel interfaces, such as example-driven query tools, that simplify data querying and analysis. Her research work combines techniques from various research fields such as UI-design, machine learning, and databases. Azza Abouzied received her doctoral degree from Yale in 2013.

From her facilitation of human-centred design workshops in Dubai, to her curation of exhibitions exploring the influence of design on health services in Nairobi- she is unfettered by the confines of one single area of design. Khulood Alawadi embraces the idea that design engineering should be viewed as a bricolage, of which, like herself, her students should feel the freedom and curiosity to explore first, and then define second. Allowing them to push the envelope on design theory and the investigation into the ways that it influences our lives. A challenger to the status quo of design engineering, Khulood Alawadi believes in questioning the �How?�. How has technology influenced the fields of art and design? How has male-dominance in the industry, centered and molded the perspective of those incoming and the work that they develop?

These associations may also play a role in the development of harmful algal blooms in coastal areas or diseases in animals. To study these complex relationships, his lab uses a variety of tools, including genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, fieldwork, microbiological, and molecular biology techniques. In addition, Shady is involved in a consortium of NYU PIs who are establishing an environmental monitoring system across the Abu Dhabi coast to collect data that will help prediction of harmful algal blooms and other environmental phenomena.

His research focuses on the intersection between politics and communications during the Age of Revolutions, and the global history of revolutionary ideals. Dr. Bowen's most recent book,The Age of Dissent: Revolution and the Power of Communication in Chile, 1780–1833(Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 2023) examines the profound political changes that accompanied the collapse of the Spanish empire in Chile. The book argues that the defining feature of this era was the emergence of a profaned and pluralistic political landscape. This represented a fundamental departure from the paradigms of unity and transcendence that structured political action during the colonial era. This profound political mutation was caused by how people practiced communication and framed its power. Social actors during this period, the book shows, had a particular view of communication: instead of seeing it as an exchange of messages or information, they saw it as the ability to affect others.The Age of Dissentanalyzes how, by reframing the power of communication and engaging in new and dissenting communicative practices, men and women of multiple political affiliations and social backgrounds revolutionized not only political institutions and ideas, but the very nature of politics. Dr. Bowen's current research delves onto the global history of the Age of Revolutions, with a focus on the emergence of radical political ideas in the revolutionary Atlantic. His next book project,The Republic of Equals: Indigenous Sovereignty and Black Republicanism in the South Atlanticcenters on the 1780 anticolonial conspiracy in Chile and the larger social and cultural context that made it possible. Scholars have dismissed this conspiracy as the feverish dream of two men influenced by utopian but impractical ideas imported from Europe. This book argues otherwise, showing that this was one of the most original and ambitious revolutionary programs ever conceived in the Atlantic world. The conspirators' goals included the abolition of slavery, the redistribution of land, and the establishment of a co-government structure with the sovereign Mapuche people. This radical project of social and political transformation, the book demonstrates, owed more to the political activities of Indigenous and African and African-descended peoples in the South Atlantic (Chile, Río de la Plata, and Peru) than to revolutionary tracts imported from Europe. By emphasizing the agency of Black and Indigenous peoples and situating the conspiracy within a broader context of resistance against colonialism,The Republic of Equalsoffers a novel framework for understanding the global history of the Enlightenment and radical republicanism. Dr. Bowen's second work-in-progress is a book provisionally titled Staging the Revolution: Luis Ambrosio Morante and the Construction of a Radical Theater Repertoire in the South Atlantic (1780–1835). The book studies the life and work of African-descended playwright and performer Luis Ambrosio Morante. Born in Buenos Aires in 1780, Morante had a successful theatrical career in what is today Uruguay, Argentina, and Chile. Morante is an exceptional historical figure, not only because of his talent, but because he left us several works detailing his political commitments, his complex views on gender, race, and social hierarchies, and his understanding of the revolutionary era and of his own place in it. This project seeks to explain how he became a successful artist as well as the wider political and intellectual implications of his work. The book examines the global networks that shaped Morante's career, how he profited from the new aesthetic conventions that associated theater with the communication of truth, and how he promoted new and revolutionary emotional regimes from the stage. Dr. Bowen is also the author ofExperimentar el cuerpo y escribir los pecados: la confesión general de José Ignacio Eyzaguirre (1799-1804)(Lima: Instituto Francés de Estudios Andinos/Instituto de Estudios Peruanos, 2014). The book analyzes and transcribes the documents that an elite man from Chile wrote to prepare himself to confess his sins. Through a careful analysis of the manuscripts, Bowen examines how Eyzaguirre experienced his sexual desires, how he was puzzled by his and other people’s bodies, and how writing mediated how he remembered, categorized, and made sense of his sinful actions. Dr. Bowen has also written articles and book chapters on the economies of attention in Chile's theater, the history of the body in colonial Latin America, the cultural project of Chile’s Unidad Popular government (1970-1973), and the relationship between social prejudices and laughter in Chile’s postcolonial theater plays.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/faculty/martin-bowen-silva/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg/1700024740740.jpg

Georgi's first-hand study of Soviet collapse culminated in the award-winning monograph Bourdieu’s Secret Admirer in the Caucasus (University of Chicago Press, 2005). Its main question was simple: What processes and contingencies transformed the provincial Soviet intellectuals, once enamored with French cinema and sociology, into the ferocious guerrilla fighters for the nationalist and religious causes?

He holds an MFA in Visual Art from Columbia University and participated in the Whitney Museum's Independent Study program. Divecha has taught at the American University of Sharjah in the College of Architecture, Art, and Design and brings extensive experience as a creative professional in the cultural and media sectors.Divecha's practice often brings invisible structures into plain view to raise questions about agency, ethics, and value. This he arrives at by challenging the nature and modes of artistic production. Meaning-making is not limited to the reception of the artwork but emerges within the social processes of artistic production itself. Divecha has come to define this approach as 'found processes' - those forces and capacities at work within the state, social, and industrial spheres. Working with available material, space, and labor, Divecha attempts to realign the social and urban systems we inhabit by introducing alterations and interventions. Disrupting maintenance rigor with vernacular gestures,Beej(2017) activates the potential for farming amongst Sharjah's municipal gardeners. Delaying a train in Paris as an orchestrated artistic gesture forTrain to Rouen(2017) questions our relationship with time, light, and the railway industry.

Eisenberg’s first monograph,Sounds of Other Shores: The Musical Poetics of Identity on Kenya’s Swahili Coast(Wesleyan University Press, forthcoming 2024), takes an ethnographic ear to appropriations of Arab and Indian styles in popular musics of the Kenyan port city of Mombasa during the twentieth century. The book reveals how Swahili-speaking Muslims in Mombasa engaged with musical style as a medium for reflecting on and mediating the complexities and contradictions of being “Swahili” in late-colonial and postcolonial Kenya. Eisenberg’s second book project is an ethnographic study of music and capitalism in Nairobi. Interim publications related to this project include the chapter, “Soundtracks in the Silicon Savannah: Digital Production, Aesthetic Entrepreneurship and the New Recording Industry in Nairobi, Kenya,” in the open-access volumeMusic and Digital Media: A Planetary Anthropology(UCL Press, 2022); and a co-authored article entitled “Mobilising African Music: How Mobile Telecommunications and Technology Firms are Transforming African Music Sectors” (2020), which is currently the “most read” work in theJournal of African Cultural Studies. In addition to music, Eisenberg’s research also focuses on sound culture. His writings on the Islamic soundscape as an arena for struggles over citizenship on the Kenyan coast appear in the interdisciplinary volumesMusic, Sound, and Space: Transformations of Public and Private Experience(Cambridge University Press, 2013) andWorship Sound Spaces: Architecture, Acoustics and Anthropology(Routledge, 2019). Eisenberg also penned the entry on “Space” for the landmark sound studies volume Keywords in Sound (Duke University Press, 2015). Since arriving at NYUAD, Eisenberg has worked collaboratively to bridge the divide between humanistic and computational approaches in music studies. He is one of the founders of NYUAD’s Music and Sound Cultures (MaSC) research group, which develops hybrid methodologies blending computational and humanistic approaches for the understanding of the music from the Gulf, East Africa, and South India. In collaboration with MaSC and the NYUAD Library, he established theAndrew Eisenberg Collection of East African Commercial Sound Recordings, which houses digital copies of hundreds of recordings produced for East African audiences between the late 1920s and the first decade of the twenty-first century. He also leads the MaSC project entitled “The Swahili Musical Imagination,” which combines computational and humanistic methods of musical analysis to explore transculturation in Swahili taarab. Eisenberg received his PhD in ethnomusicology from Columbia University, and undertook postdoctoral work from 2011 to 2013 with Prof. Georgina Born’s European Research Council project “Music, Digitization, Mediation.” Among his recent awards and fellowships are the Society for Ethnomusicology’s 2018 Jaap Kunst Prize for the most significant publication in the field of ethnomusicology during the preceding year, and a residential fellowship with the Bayreuth Academy of Advanced African Studies (2021). Before joining NYUAD, he taught at Northwestern University, Stony Brook University, and Bard College. At NYUAD, Eisenberg serves as Associate Professor of Music and Program Head for Music, and administers the minor in Arab Music Studies. He is also a Global Network Associate Professor at NYU New York, affiliated with the departments of Music and Anthropology.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/faculty/andrew-j-eisenberg/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg/1700024413240.jpg

In 2007, she graduated with a PhD in biophysics from Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany. As a postdoctoral fellow, she worked at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPIDS) in Göttingen. From September 2011, she became a group leader at the MPIDS Göttingen and led the group ""Pattern Formation in Biological Systems"" for about ten years. Azam Gholami is a physicist interested in collective behavior and non-linear dynamics in living systems. She and her team recently conducted experiments with the slime moldDictyosteliumdiscoideum, an experimental model of cell migration. StarvingDictyosteliumcells secrete the chemoattractant cAMP, which stimulates the cells to migrate in head-to-tail streams, eventually leading to the formation of fruiting bodies required for cell survival. She and her coworkers generated substrates containing pillars of different sizes and patterns. They performed mathematical analysis of cAMP images and the migrating cells to determine how theDictyosteliumcells interpreted waves of chemoattractant disrupted by obstacles. This analysis, published in the journal ofScience Signaling,could help understand how collections of cells interact with spatial barriers in their environment (https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scisignal.aaz3975).In addition, Azam Gholami is interested in the dynamics of cilia and flagella, slender hair-like appendages that protrude from the cell surface and act as the fundamental unit of motion, performing periodic whip-like motion to provide the driving force for fluid transport or locomotion of the cell. She and her collaborators recently demonstrated the biocompatibility and efficiency of an artificial light-driven energy module and a motility functional unit by integrating light-switchable photosynthetic vesicles with demembranated flagella. The flagellar propulsion is coupled to the beating frequency, and dynamic ATP synthesis in response to illumination allowed them to control the beating frequency of flagella in a light-dependent manner. In addition, they verified the functionality of light-powered synthetic vesicles in vitro motility assays by encapsulating microtubules assembled with force-generating kinesin-1 motors and the energy module to investigate the dynamics of a contractile filamentous network in cell-like compartments by optical stimulation. Integration of this photosynthetic system with various biological building blocks such as cytoskeletal filaments and molecular motors may contribute to the bottom-up synthesis of artificial cells that can undergo motor-driven morphological deformations and exhibit directional motion in a light-controllable fashion. This work was recently published in the journalACS Synthetic Biologyand highlighted on the journal's cover (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssynbio.1c00071).",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/science/faculty/azam-gholami/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg/1669208642517.jpg

Her work, for example, has examined how the strategic value of mineral deposits for the decarbonization of the global economy and the fourth industrial revolution intersects with a changing post-carbon resource map accelerating geopolitical realignments between the developing and developed world.

Peisakhin is currently finishing a book project, titledContested Nationhood: Imperial Legacies and Conflicting Political Identities in Ukraine, on the persistence of imperial-era political identities in Ukraine, some of which are at the root of the ongoing conflict over Ukraine’s statehood and future political trajectory. This project draws on a natural experiment of history that divided a homogenous population of ethnic Ukrainians between Russian and Austrian empires. In addition, jointly with Noam Lupu, Peisakhin is also working on a book manuscript on inter-generational persistence of victim identities and on the impact of these identities on political behavior. The project draws on multi-generational surveys in Cambodia, Crimea, and Guatemala. Peisakhin's research combines multiple methods including experiments, surveys, ethnography, and archival research.

Her sculptures pick up on historic sculptural and architectonic paradigms, which she modifies and places in constellations such that the presence of the works is interwoven with glimpses of past cultural formations. Addressing the beholder's bodily reality, her art sustains a situated experience, while also charting fields of associations that have bearing on his or her position, actual as much as imagined, in the world. Peters pursues these concerns both in sculpture strictly conceived and in a range of other media, exploring a variety of formats (sound installation, moving image, film, performance).In 2009–2012, Peters undertook extensive studies into the oeuvre of Rudolph Schindler, an endeavor that bore fruit in a number of works that take inspiration from the architect’s buildings. In 2013, she began to probe various questions that had arisen during her work on these projects. With the sculptureInterface No. 1, realized in 2012, she embarked on a multifaceted investigation of the form of the cube as such. A little later, she gathered initial ideas for a translation ofInterface No. 1into acoustic structures that the audience would experience in an installation with the titleSonicCube(2014–). In the course of her examination of the form of the cube, Peters has devoted particular attention to its eleven nets, permutations that served as the point of departure for the sculpturesPandora’s Box(2016) andUntitled (Blaue Blume)(2017–18).Works such asTango(2013–16) andZabriskie Point(2013) have a basis in architecture, while also reflecting specific cultural or historic contexts. They are conceived as situations to which the viewer is encouraged to relate by contemplating or moving around them. Both works are composed of different elements whose arrangement in the space conveys an impression of a cohesive ensemble, addressing itself not just to the eye but also to the sense of touch and sensorimotor experience.The artist has had several solo exhibitions, including at Kunstmuseum Bonn (Zeichnung heute V,2007); Kunstverein Ruhr, Essen (Modification—constantly climbing stones, 2009); Kunstsæle, Berlin (Interplay, 2011); Galerie Aanant & Zoo, Berlin (Bilateral, Diagonal, Cubical, 2012); and the Arts Center Project Space at New York University Abu Dhabi (Pandora’s Box, 2016).Since 2007, Sandra Peters’s work has been shown in numerous group exhibitions in Germany and abroad, including at Temporäre Kunsthalle, Berlin (Zeigen. An Audio Tour through Berlinby Karin Sander, 2009); the MAK–Austrian Museum of Applied Arts/Contemporary Art, Vienna (Envisioning Buildings. Reflecting Architecture in Contemporary Art Photography,2011); Daimler Contemporary, Berlin (Conceptual Tendencies. 1960s to Today. Part II. Body, Space, Volume, 2013); and the Maraya Art Center, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (Collectivity. Objects and Associations in the UAE Art World, 2017).The monographPER/TRANS. Performing the Cube, Transforming the Cube. Works by Sandra Peters 1998–2017 was released by Verlag für moderne Kunst (VfmK), Vienna, in January 2018. The book contains numerous illustrations, notes by the artist on all series, and thematic essays by Fiona McGovern, Michael Ned Holte, Gregor Stemmrich, and Peters herself.Sandra Peters studied at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris; the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Art; and the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where she was a Master’s student from 2002 until 2004. She was a visiting professor at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California, in 1999–2000, and at the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California, in 2011 and 2012.

She is a historian of Africa specializing in West African colonial and postcolonial history with a focus on Muslim societies. Her research has focused on the cultural history of Islam, slavery, race, gender, and nation in what she calls ""the Saharan West,"" or what is today primarily the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.Dr. Pettigrew's first book,To Invoke the Invisible in the Sahara: Islam, Spiritual Mediation, and Social Change(Cambridge University Press, 2023), traces the shifting roles of Muslim spiritual mediators and their Islamic esoteric sciences in what is now the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. This project was particularly interested in answering questions of how local inhabitants use local knowledge and borrow exogenous concepts to respond to new historical circumstances. This research demonstrates the value of studying the marginal, the liminal, and the in-between ⎯ not only when it comes to geographic spaces such as the Sahara, which is often imagined as an empty barrier between two more significant regions on the African continent, but also when it comes to the politically peripheral, the culturally hybrid, and socially heterogenous. Dr. Pettigrew has published inThe Journal of African History, Mediterranean Politics,Islamic Africa, and the collected volumePolitiques de la culture et cultures du politique dans l’ouest saharien. She has also recently co-edited a special issue ofL'Ouest saharienentitledFemmes du Sahara-Sahel : transformations sociales et conditions de vie(2022).Dr. Pettigrew's second major research project traces the emergence of the underground kādeḥīn (the proletariat, or ""toilers"") movement in the West African country of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. Linked to larger Communist-Maoist political movements in the 1960s and 1970s, the kādeḥīn and its members constituted a rare moment of leftist and non-religious political influence in a thoroughly Muslim space. This book project,Cries of the Oppressed:  Leftists, Arab Nationalism, and National Identity in Early Post-Independence Mauritania, presents the Mauritanian movement as a counter-narrative to histories of Islamic reform movements in West Africa in the second half of the twentieth century. Even though this moment of youth-led and leftist engagement was short-lived in Mauritania, the political pressure thekādeḥīnplaced on the country's new and single-party state led to major changes in the political direction, economic choices, and cultural norms in Mauritania.Another ongoing research project expands these interests and builds on her personal history as a former Peace Corps volunteer (Mauritania, 2003-2005) to writea history of the Peace Corps in Africa. This research, based on oral history and archival research in several countries used as representative case studies, will be of interest to those working on development studies, decolonization and the Global 60s and 70s, the role of US American foreign policy in Africa, and knowledge production.Dr. Pettigrew's research has been supported by the Fulbright Scholars Program at l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (l'EHESS) in Paris, France, as well as the Fulbright-Hays, the American Institute of Maghrib Studies, Mellon Foundation, Erasmus Mundus, as well as a number of research fellowships at NYUAD and Stanford University.

His dissertation on music in Syria, funded by research grants from SSRC and Fulbright-Hays, won the 2001 Malcolm Kerr Award for Best Dissertation in the Social Sciences from the Middle East Studies Association. Shannon's research, scholarship, and teaching focus primarily on the Arab world and the Mediterranean, with special attention to the cultural politics of musical performance, collective memory, and transnational migration in the Middle East and North Africa and across the Mediterranean. His first book, Among the Jasmine Trees: Music and Modernity in Contemporary Syria (2006), analyzes how classical Arab music performance in pre-conflict Syria was a vehicle for crafting modern sensibilities marked by affect and sentiment. His second scholarly book, Performing al-Andalus: Music and Nostalgia across the Mediterranean (2015), explores the rhetorical force of the legacy of al-Andalus (medieval Iberia) and the role of musical performance in debates about cultural memory in three highly contested sites of nostalgic cultural production: Damascus, Fez, and Granada. Funded by a research awards from Fulbright and Guggenheim, the book is the first to tackle these broad questions in a comparative and circum-Mediterranean perspective. Shannon has also penned a novella, A Wintry Day in Damascus: Syrian Stories (2012), set on the eve of major social and political upheaval in the Syrian capital. Shannon is currently conducting research on the role of music in the lived experiences of displaced Syrians in Turkey and across Europe.

To answer these questions, Vial takes an interdisciplinary approach drawing from social-psychological, sociological, organizational, and developmental perspectives. A common thread is a focus on the interplay between beliefs about roles (i.e., what traits are viewed as required for success in a given domain) and beliefs about groups (i.e., group stereotypes).Vial received her PhD in Psychology from Yale University in 2018.

His research focuses on political violence, war, foreign policy, social theory, and the self. Alshaibi has an area specialty in the modern middle east, especially modern Iraq. He explores how ""big"" events such as war, shifts in geopolitical strategy, and state behavior at the international level can be and often are driven by small groups of actors seeking power and recognition. In his work, Alshaibi aims to gain direct access to the powerful and influential in order to capture how politics functions at the level of face-to-face interaction. Alshaibi is currently writing a book about the involvement of the Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein in mobilizing US support for regime change in Iraq between 1990-2003. His book,The Anatomy of Regime Change, emphasizes the extreme degree to which US foreign policy on Iraq was shaped and influenced by a small group of Iraqi exiles living in the US. Though there has been much scholarly emphasis on America intervening in Iraq, his research brings into focus Iraqis intervening in American politics.  He draws on rare archival records and interviews with Iraqi activists and the principal US architects of the wars in Iraq, including most of the George W. Bush war cabinet. More broadly, the book explains how diaspora, transnational, or otherwise transborder activists mobilize to shape the foreign policies of host states against their home regimes. Alshaibi's future research agenda explores questions about how political officials make sense of their participation in killing civilians and how distributed decision-making transforms moral questions into technical questions. Alshaibi earned his PhD in sociology at UCLA. His research has been supported by the US Department of Education, the American Academic Research Institute in Iraq, the Hoover Institution, the Mellon Foundation, and the Forum Transregionale Studien among other organizations. He was awarded the Peter Kollock Teaching Prize in the Department of Sociology, and the UCLA Distinguished Teacher Award, UCLA's highest honor for teaching across the entire university.He primarily teaches sociological and social theory and has developed his own course about the problems of selfhood in modernity.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/wisam-alshaibi/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg/1695105593628.jpg

He uses qualitative, comparative-historical, and computational methods, including in-depth interviews, social network analysis, computational text analysis, and agent-based modeling. His previous research focused on various boundary processes in social, economic, and political settings, includingstatus homophily in social networks,residential segregation by income, andcollective identity formation in social movements. Building on the insights from these studies, his book,White-Collar Blues: The Making of the Transnational Turkish Middle Class(under advanced contract with Columbia University Press), examines the rise of a new upper-middle class fraction in the age of globalization and its discontents with work. During the 1960s-70s’ developmentalist era, state-employed doctors, lawyers, and engineers were the role models for “making it.” However, the post-1980s neoliberal era, marked by increasing foreign direct investment and Turkey’s tighter integration into the global economy, witnessed the emergence of new hegemonic symbols of success: professional-managerial employees of transnational corporations. Focusing on their quality of work-life narratives through more than 100 in-depth interviews held in Istanbul and New York City, the book follows these professionals through the employment life course: i) selection into, ii) surviving within, and iii) opting out of corporate careers. Despite their upward mobility in Turkey and beyond through employment at world-renowned transnational corporations, many business professionals’ narratives resonate withwhite-collar blues: feelings of disappointment and exhaustion that emanate from demanding and unfulfilling corporate careers. Extending from the Turkish case, the book develops a theory of middle-class alienation that accounts for how middle-class investments in education and high hopes for corporate careers clash with the realities of poor work-life balance, low intrinsic satisfaction, and a lack of meaning from labor.White-Collar Bluesreveals the hidden costs of sacrificing these essentials for higher pay and status by capitalizing on how the so-called “Good Jobs” can fail their occupants. His other current major project aims to map the field of political opinion in contemporary Turkey and its change over time. This study focuses on the role of media in the rise of authoritarianism by combining computational text analysis with social networks. Mustafa received his BSc and MSc in Industrial Engineering from Bogazici University and briefly worked as an engineer before starting his PhD in Sociology at Yale University.",https://nyuad.nyu.edu/content/nyuad/en/home/academics/divisions/social-science/faculty/mustafa-yavas/_jcr_content/bio-info/image.img.jpg/1688996549189.jpg
